 Game Rules
* Hamka is a board game designed to be played by two players. The objective is to "eat" all the pieces of the other side. 
* This game is played only on the darker tiles of the board. Normal pieces may only move diagonally forward one space at a time, if a same-side piece is present, 
   they are not able to move.
* Pieces may only eat other-side pieces if there is another piece diagonal to them, and the tile behind that piece is open.
* If the opportunity to eat a piece is present, the player must eat the piece.
* Normal pieces that reach the other end of the board from their side are crowned Queen. Queens may move diagonally forwards and backwards , and for long distance .
* Queens can get out from the wall and enter from the other side.
* The first move is made by the black player side. Good luck and have fun! 
* There are other additions that will  achieve later during the course.
